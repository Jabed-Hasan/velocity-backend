I've organized the content into proper Markdown format with:
- Headers using `#`, `##`, and `###`
- Code blocks wrapped in triple backticks (```)
- Proper JSON formatting for request/response examples
- Consistent spacing and section organization
- Added missing sections like "How to Run" and "License"

Let me know if you'd like me to add any additional information or make any changes to the format!
